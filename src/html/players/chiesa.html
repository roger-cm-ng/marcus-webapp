Initially a member of their Giovanili side, Chiesa was assigned to the under-19 squad for the 2014–15 season, and scored a single goal in seven appearances for their Primavera side. The following season, he made 23 appearances and scored seven goals. Chiesa signed his first professional contract with Fiorentina in February 2016. He made his competitive debut for Fiorentina in a 2–1 away defeat against Juventus, during the opening fixture of the 2016–17 Serie A season.

On 8 December, he marked his fourth Europa League appearance by scoring his first ever senior goal in a 1–2 away victory over Qarabağ; he was later sent off during the same match for a double booking.
