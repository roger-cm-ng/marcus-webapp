                    Early Career
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On 27 July 2022, Kim signed for Serie A club Napoli for a reported fee of €18 million, as a replacement for Kalidou Koulibaly, who departed to join Chelsea. On 21 August, he scored his first goal for Napoli from a header in stoppage time during a 4–0 victory over Monza.

In his second month in Italy, he was named Serie A Player of the Month for September 2022. During his first season playing for Napoli, Kim was an integral part of Napoli's victory to its third Serie A title in the 2022–23 season, the first one in nearly three decades, being named the Serie A Best Defender of the season.

                    Later Career
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On 18 July 2023, Bundesliga club Bayern Munich announced that they had signed Kim on a deal until 30 June 2028. Bayern reportedly triggered a release clause in Kim's Napoli contract by paying €50 million, and so Kim became the most expensive Asian footballer in history by surpassing Shoya Nakajima's transfer fee of €35 million. He is the second South Korean player to sign with the club, the first being Jeong Woo-yeong.
